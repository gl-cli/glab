## Synopsis

Verifies and displays information about your authentication state.

By default, this command checks the authentication state of the GitLab instance 
determined by your current context (`git remote`, `GITLAB_HOST` environment variable, 
or configuration). Use `--all` to check all configured instances, or `--hostname` to 
check a specific instance.
