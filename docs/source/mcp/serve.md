# `glab mcp serve`

Start MCP server with stdio transport

## Synopsis

Start a Model Context Protocol server that exposes GitLab functionality
as tools for AI assistants like Claude Code.

The server uses stdio transport for communication and provides tools for:

- Managing issues (list, create, update, close, add notes)
- Managing merge requests (list, create, update, merge, add notes)  
- Managing projects (list, get details)
- Managing CI/CD pipelines and jobs
- And more GitLab functionality

Configure this server in Claude Code by adding to your MCP settings:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "glab": {
      "command": "glab",
      "args": ["mcp", "serve"]
    }
  }
}

```plaintext
glab mcp serve [flags]
```

## Examples

```console
$ glab mcp serve

```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```plaintext
  -h, --help   Show help for this command.
```
